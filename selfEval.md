# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- Comparison operators feel like the easiest part of the lesson - feeling confident!
2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- I feel confident in using them. These are nice to practice - the `&&` operator is intuitive but I have to think to remember that the or operator is `||` and that they're called "pipes" (i referred the them as bars in my Loom).
3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- I feel confident in using simple if statements. 
4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- I took about 40 min to complete the exercises, challenge, & recording. What took more time than I estimated was pausing to remember to `git commit` frequently enough. I'm working on building that habit.
5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I'd like to continue to practice interpolation syntax. I'll write more if statements with console.logs that include interpolation and include it in exercises when I can.
6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I have `remainder operator` on my list of things to research from this lesson and exercises.
